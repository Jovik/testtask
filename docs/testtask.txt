Test Task

Description:
Write a python script which implements the following steps in an automated manner and is
able to run on your favorite platform:

1. Downloads two different versions of VLC player from
    http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/

2. Compiles them from source

3. Plays a video file (http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/8/f/68f212d7-f58d-4542-890d-65d7e790f2e0/The_Magic_of_Flight_720.exe) with the compiled binaries where video file is fed through API/CMD line (preferably use API)

4. Measures & logs & plots cpu, memory usage, thread count (come up with any other performance/resource related parameters you can think about).

5. Stores the data which is collected in step #4 in a database (f.ex. sqlite, psql)

6. Compares two versions of VLC using the values, which are obtained in step 4. (Plot performance parameters on the same plot, make them visible etc)

7. Prepare a web page to display the information on step #6 by using your favorite web framework (flask, web.py, django), which runs on localhost using simpe python http server.

8. [OPTIONAL] Run VLC with both versions to check for memory leaks and create some sort of report for the results

9. [OPTIONAL] Try to measure code coverage while VLC is playing a video file. Use any code coverage tool you prefer.

10. Prepare a report explaining your findings
